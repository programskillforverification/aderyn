# High Issues

## H-1: Using `delegatecall` in loop

When calling `delegatecall` the same `msg.value` amount will be accredited multiple times.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 16](../tests/contract-playground/src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	            target.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doSomething(uint256)", i));
	```

</details>



## H-2: Delegatecall made by the function without checks on any adress.

Introduce checks on the address

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 14](../tests/contract-playground/src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    function doSomethingElse(address target) external {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

- Found in src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 21](../tests/contract-playground/src/inheritance/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	        return ecrecover(theHash, v, r, s);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/inheritance/IContractInheritance.sol [Line: 2](../tests/contract-playground/src/inheritance/IContractInheritance.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0;
	```

- Found in src/inheritance/InheritanceBase.sol [Line: 2](../tests/contract-playground/src/inheritance/InheritanceBase.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/eth2/DepositContract.sol [Line: 113](../tests/contract-playground/src/eth2/DepositContract.sol#L113)

	```solidity
	            abi.encodePacked(sha256(abi.encodePacked(signature[:64])), sha256(abi.encodePacked(signature[64:], bytes32(0))))
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event Do(uint256 something);
	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-6: Inconsistency in declaring uint256/uint (or) int256/int variables within a contract. Use explicit size declarations (uint256 or int256).

Consider keeping the naming convention consistent in a given contract. Explicit size declarations are preferred (uint256, int256) over implicit ones (uint, int) to avoid confusion.
